A Flappy Bird like game that uses a feedforward neural network to play the game, and a genetic algorithm to learn how to play the game.

The player's bird which is actually just a box (has a red colored outline and filled with yellow color inside) can be controlled by the human player by pressing the `space` key in the keyboard.

A human player can compete with the each generated birds controlled by their own neural network.

Anyone can [download the released executables (click here to download)](https://github.com/mrdcvlsc/flappy-ffnn-ga/releases) and extract it then run the program, these release executables are only supported on x86-64 or 64-bit systems.

In windows, one might need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022) in their system if the release versions of the executables is not working.
